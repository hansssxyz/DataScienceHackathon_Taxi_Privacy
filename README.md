# Taxicab

This github repo is part of our data science hackathon project, in which we are given a set of data from new york taxi driveres, including the time, duration, location of each trip, numbers of passengers on board, amount of tips given, etc. We are challenged to develop a differentially-private scheme to present the data while also preserving interesting and insightful trends on the data.
